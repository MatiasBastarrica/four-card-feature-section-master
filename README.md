## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Box-shadow

### What I learned

During the development of this challenge I got used to placing each card in a separate grid cell.

### Continued development

I need more practice applying grid so I'm looking forward to start using it more instead of flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me create the box-shadow for each card. I'd recommend this article to anyone still learning this concept.
